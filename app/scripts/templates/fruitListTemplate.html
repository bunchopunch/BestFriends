Next:
- Zombie views (onClose)
- html() is killing the bound (jquery) events on switching view.
- Get logic (e.g. user level) outside of templates 
  - View helper functions to manage logic
- UI State! (e.g. keeping sort prefs on multiple views)
- Maybe move to CIDs for subviews?
- Test task... does it need Modernizr re-added?
